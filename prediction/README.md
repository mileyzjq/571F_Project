# A network-assisted approach to predicting passing distributions #
## Final project for EECE571F at UBC ##
###Autumn 2015###

This is the directory where the linear regression occurs.

* `baseline-average.py`: Our baseline predictor which predicts based on the
  average of past passing networks
* `classes.py`: Provides interface for features
* `pdPrediction-team.py`: Our linear predictor with team-specific weights
* `pdPrediction.py`: Our linear predictor with model-shared weights
