			"contents": "Package Control Messages\n========================\n\nDebugger\n--------\n\n  For getting set up see https://github.com/daveleroy/sublime_debugger\n\n  For a full list of changes see https://github.com/daveleroy/sublime_debugger/commits\n\n\n  Version 0.6.7\n\n  - Fixes an issue with the latest version of vscode lldb\n\n\n  Version 0.6.6\n\n  - Allow inputing debugger commands directly into the debugger console\n  - Auto complete for debugger commands (not all adapters support this)\n  - A number of performance/usability improvements for the debugger console\n\n\n  Version 0.6.4\n\n  - Added support for vscode-js-debug for chrome/node/edge adapters\n  - Improved snippet support\n\n\n  Version 0.6.3\n\n  - Adjusted the calculation for determining a good value for ui_rem_width_scale\n  - Added setting ui_rem_width_scale_adjust_automatically for disabling automatic calculation of ui_rem_width_scale\n\n\n  Version 0.6.2\n\n  - Fixes a layout issue on Linux\n\n\n  Version 0.6.1\n\n  - Fixes an issue with the debugger panel not being correctly sized on Windows/Linux #121\n  - Fixes an issue with hover evaluation #152 (@ta946)\n\n\n  Version 0.6.0\n\n  - This update changes how the output is handled. Instead of showing up as a tab in the debugger UI the layout is changed to a split view and the output is created in a standard view.
